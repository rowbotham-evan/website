## Movitation
Different people get inspired or movitated by different perspectives. Before we delve into the Turing and the mathematics, I would like to provide you with three different perspectives, hopefully one (or all!) of which will inspire you. Feel free to only engage with the perspectives that feel appealing or tantalizing. Once you're excited curious about the idea, then we will explore the math together! 


## Historical Perspective 
Our story begins with Alan Turing (1912-1954), debately one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th Century. He is renown for his [Turing Machine]() and [Turing Test](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/uli3iiu9/release/2) -- super popular with AI! What we are interested in though is what made "the Alan Turing" venture into (mathematical) biology? Like many from his generation Turing was enticed and inspired by Thompson's *On Growth and Form*.

D'Arcy Thompson (1860-1948), is regarded as one of the first mathematical biologist. He was formalled trained as a zoologist and had a deep love for the classics. Thompson was skeptical of Darwinism as an generative explanation of new forms. Since humans, frogs, and other living things are are made of normal materials, they too should have to obey the laws of physics. 


## Logical Perspective



## Applied (Application) Perspective
History-blah blah, Logic-blah blah. What can this do for us? Grow a friggin organ! No, I'm serious: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02183-9). There is also the recent [organs on a chip](https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/human-organs-on-chips/), which essential let's test drugs on real human tissue at a faster pace than when we used animal subjects.
