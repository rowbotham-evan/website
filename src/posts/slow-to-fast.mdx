A culture obsessed with speed. A fragile culture. Everywhere in tech and finance we prioritize speed: “iterate faster,” “turn comments by X time.” University students are encouraged to drop out<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> (even I considered it for a moment). Even within universities themselves the culture abides—what are you studying? How are you optimizing every decision and leveraging every possible resource to that end? A pre-med taking a math class—what a waste of time and attention. Don’t worry though: what you miss in accuracy can be made up for with speed. Just fail faster, harder.

## Being Squeezed & Overfitting

My family would always tell me that university is “your oyster.” All my friends see universities as “their lemons,” obsessed with finding all the tools they can to squeeze every last drop: alumni connections, preprofessional clubs, and easy GPA boosters. Why is that? Perhaps partially because of the hikes in tuition rates and ROI calculations. But a large part is also because they themselves feel squeezed by the real world. In a world that has constructed algorithms (which you can now game with the internet) to get into elite schools, startup accelerators, government jobs, etc., how could they possibly hope to compete with a “non-trad” (or, more accurately, nonlinear) background? Specialization breeds optimization, and optimization breeds specialization.

What’s a young adult supposed to do when they believe the world is already squeezing them? Interested in physics? PhD or industry? hep-th or experimentalist research? String theory or CFTs?

Blaring sirens going off at every crossroad:

**Warning**: If you choose “this path,” it would significantly restrict your future options—are you sure you want that?  
**Warning**: If you don’t start preparing for this now, you will be inescapably behind and need to spend the next six years unwinding it.

In moments of intense squeezing, students overfit. Overfitting is often a strong temporary competitive advantage: being into “niche” sectors that allow you to compete in smaller markets (e.g. being the only undergrad interested in glue polymer companies), but it reduces your long-term compounding advantages. Continuously deploying this overfitting strategy neglects that most “overnight successes” have been decades of dedication, commitment, and refinement of skills before they got traction. And more importantly, if you're a chronic overfitter you risk having a *work life* and a *personal life*. 

## The Nonlinear Path



People who do interesting things often recount their journeys using words like "accidental" or "serendipitious". There's no disputing that luck is a factor. However, this description never sat right with me: "How do all the interesting people become accidentally interesting? Surely, these people weren't divinely ordained -- so how come they all attribute a big part of their interestingness to serendipity or luck?".

## The Linear Path

When you join a “pre-professional” group or any tribe in college (the physics majors, the artists, the hackers, the premeds), I have observed most forfeit core idiosyncratic habits, hobbies, or interests to conform. The trouble this creates is that your career becomes the core of your identity. Unfortunately, if you are not careful, your professional interests can quietly consume your identity—eating one interesting habit at a time. Moreover, passive statements like, “You aren’t a true banker if you don’t enjoy going out,” or “No banker reads physics papers,” slowly strip you of uniqueness in favor of becoming more relatable—closer to the in-group. (This is normal and, in fact, programmed by evolution!)

## Breaking the Illusion

**Having Fun Most of the Way**

![Linear vs Nonlinear Plot](images/nonlinear_vs_linear_plot.png)

As Professor (insert optionality) acutely notes, there tend to be broadly two types of people: (1) the safety-net acquirers and (2) the lottery-ticket pickers. Surely our only options aren’t going to be Evercore ⇒ Blackstone ⇒ GSB (“the golden path,” including other professional equivalents think law, writing, etc.) or searching for a hyperscaler, stint at a hedge fund, or quant (“the deferred life plan”). These aren't the only options.


In a culture that worships optionality, choose commitment.

### Specialization

Being too fluid gets you \< 1,000 hours everywhere (“I don’t know, but I’ll just try A, B, C…”). Being too crystallized gets you ≥ 10,000 hours in something quickly—potentially great for hardcore experts or individual contributors. Being amorphous gets you ≥ 4,000 hours in three things, approaching a true “triple threat.”

A good metaphor I often think about is Bruce Lee’s famous quote:

> “I am not afraid of a person who knows 10,000 kicks. But I am afraid of a person who knows one kick but practices it 10,000 times.”

I wonder how scared Bruce would be of the man who practiced the same kick and punch 5,000 times each?

Often people critique an amorphous and nonlinear background, saying the top 99–100 percentile are all people who practice the same kick 10,000 times, or “go extremely deep.” **In fact, that’s completely backwards.** That’s a style (more in the next section), but it’s not even true that that’s the best approach. For example, June Huh<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> dropped out to be a poet and then became a Fields Medalist. Ed Witten has a BA in history and is one of the most respected mathematical physicists alive. Brian Chesky got a degree in Fine Arts from RISD. (How much of Airbnb’s success is product quality/design? It’s probably a lot—and nonlinear.) Freeman Dyson never got a PhD.  
*(Sherlock Holmes, Brian May, Mad Max, Jussieu Park)*

**Greatness & The Measurement Problem**

We're taught that in order to big things, we need a plan. This is only true if said big thing is *obvious*. Any place that is interesting, however, is by defintion not obvious. In fact, having to follow a clear plan is precisely what limits us and undercuts our ability to become great. Becuase having a plan assumes that we *already know what and just how important every step to achieving that is* and that *we know all the steps to get where we are going*. 

### Empiricism (Grit) vs. Rationalism (Rethink)

Comment on *a bias towards action* and *“fail faster.”*

Sam Altman<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>’s mantra:

> “But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.”

**Heuristics to Rethink**  
- Empiricism: Bubbling energy or lightning enthusiasm.  
- Empiricism: When you have two strong candidates or hypotheses.  
- Empirisim: Exploring a new dimension—it’s the fastest way to see if you are romanticizing something you have never done.  
- Rethink: “Emotional black hole”: when a commitment feels like a mental weight all day long and is impacting other areas of your life.  
- Rethink: Close friends mentioning (usually passively) a substantial change in behavior: little comments about your behavior from friends often signal that you are so unhappy somewhere that it’s leaking into other aspects of your life.

**How to Do It**  
- **“Strong” Empiricism ⇒ 90-day challenge**  
    - Do the *x* activity every day for 90 days straight. It will reveal a lot.
- **“Weak” Empiricism ⇒ Smart Experiments**  
  - Low-risk, easily runnable experiments.  
    - For example: “Do I like my lab work or the group I’m working with?” ⇒ Work on it solely by yourself for a week and then decide.  
  - As Jeff Bezos<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> describes, easily reversible decisions should be treated differently.  
- **Constructing counterfactuals**  
  - Often we get acclimated to the world quickly. A technique to see if you are doing something for prestige or money is to construct a counterfactual scenario. For example: “If biologists were the most respected scientists, would I still feel bad about pursuing my interest in biology?”  
    - If no ⇒ prestige was a large factor.  
    - If yes ⇒ prestige was a small factor.

### Climbing Our Own Mountains

You are not your tools. You are not your plan. Optimization might get you the results you want, but at the expense of living a fragile life.

Some principles I practice in my ascent:  
- Don’t mistake the forest for the trees. Base my identity on clear boundaries and fuzzy categories.  
- Be intentional and fiercely committed to my interests and idiosyncratic habits or hobbies. Trust Behaviors. Trust Expontentials..
- Think in terms of 7–15-year projects and what I enjoy doing, **not careers**.  
- Finding what the most important problem I can solve **now** is (combination of skills + macro environment)
- Don’t confuse the stories I tell myself for motivation with what’s true or reality.  
- Fight reverting to the mean every single day on the axes that are most important to me.

Jobs didn’t say the thinkers are the builders; he said “the thinkers are the doers.” Don’t just think in terms of building—think in terms of doing: discovering, creating, morphing, etc. The most entrepreneurial “thing” isn’t being a dropout founder making another startup for the sake of building; it’s about searching patiently for years or decades for the right time to finally solve a significant problem you’ve been thinking about. (This is true for scientists as well.) No true entrepreneurial is looking for a blueprint, they are looking for inspiration.

In my life right now, I want to travel to places where people aren’t questioning what I *have* but are curious and even puzzled about what I *bring*.
