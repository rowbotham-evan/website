This is an interesting tidbit. Floating Point Group–a crypto startup–was the first ever internship I got my freshman year of college. I was assigned to the trading team and working on implementing a RL algorithm (inspired by the [Almgren-Chriss Model](https://github.com/viai957/Optimal-Portfolio-Transactions/blob/master/Almgren%20and%20Chriss%20Model.ipynb)) to reduce slippage. 

Unforunately, a week into my internship FPG got hacked for 20mm. An [article](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/14/crypto-prime-broker-fpg-loses-up-to-20m-in-cyber-attack) was published that week, detailing the specifics of the incident. ([another later article](https://blockworks.co/news/floating-point-up-against-wall)) Shortly after, FPG terminated my internship and eventually went backrupt. 

Overall, an insane story, but I'm grateful that I made some cool friends from FPG that I still talk to!
