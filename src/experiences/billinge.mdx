These past five months, I have been working in [The Billinge Group](https://thebillingegroup.com/). Broadly, I have been contributing to solving the [nanostructure problem](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v3/25), through maintaining and deploying  packages (old and new) within our Atomic Structure Analysis Software, [Diffpy](https://www.diffpy.org/).
 
* Lead the deployment and maintenance [pdffit2](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.pdffit2) and [pdfgui](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.pdfgui). 
* Documenting and formalizing a streamlined software deployment process for all current & future packages within the group with [Andrew Yang](https://github.com/Sparks29032). 
* Collaborating with Ibrhaim Adnan (deleted his LinkedIn) on designing novel CV algorithms for classifying x-ray diffraction data.
