  blurb: "Choosing my major"

Initially, I wanted to study philosophy at university. Philosophy, I thought was the closest I could get to the two things I have been chasing my entire life: truth and understanding. But then my Dad was nervous about me finding a job and heavily encouraged me to study something else. So, I decided to study what people always told me I had a knack for and for what I thought was as close as I could get to philosophy, math. To be a philosopher is to attempt to formalize visceral and intuitive experiences into precise language and axioms; replace experiences with phenomena, and language with abstract symbols, and we pretty much arrive at math. 

Being in my second year, I think studying applied math was the best decision. Undergrad, is about gaining extremely broad knowledge, and to train one’s mind with select problem-solving approaches. Math’s job is identifying patterns that allow for us to be both be as general and precise as possible – an invaluable skill for any thinker. If we only retain 15% of what we learn in college, why not pick the most challenging subject? In other words, if the knowledge output does not really matter so much, why not choose the subject that has the most cognitively demanding input? 

I want to make a distinction though. Congitively demanding input does not mean that it should consume your schedule, or that you have to spend all day banging your head against the wall. The whole days you spend trying, are an indicator that – unless you obssessed with the problems in that subject, and getting enjoyment **internally** – that subject is not for you. Time is invaluable. Don't spend it worrying about "being good" at a subject at school or even at school in general, spend it consumed by a solving a puzzle or building something cool. For me, math is hard, but not grueling, and I still get to do fun (and probably way more beneficial for my learning) side projects. 

The next statement to confront was: “Sure, you are good at math, something general. No one hires people for general things. Why would I pick a math major over an engineering major?” Generally, I would agree and hire the engineering major as well. Although, I think there is something missing from this analysis. There is a small subset of math students, I would choose over almost any engineering student (yes, even for an engineering specific task) and think it relies on the following. 

The power of something being general is useful not only for its appliciablility but its derivibility. Math majors, use more general, abstract tools than engineering. An engineer understands the tools and when to use select ones, but the engineer cannot derive useful tools without some deep mathematical knowledge. Math people, although having more general tools, can derive new ones. Which is exactly because they are not bound to a particular part of engineering and so  have more freedom (and less bias) in their creation of new tools. A strong math person can be taught [polymer science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/polymer-science) or [molecular dynamics](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/tutorial/NCSA2002/pdf/01_intro_to_md.pdf) pretty quickly, but I would think it would take most electrical engineers longer to figure out.

Becoming more mathematically rigorous, has made me better at quantifying uncertainy ([Fermi Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem#:~:text=Fermi%20problems%20typically%20involve%20making,be%20derived%20using%20dimensional%20analysis.)), following arguments, and presenting my own ideas. Math has also, due its rigour, furthered what it means to understand for me, and granted me glimpses of truth. 

Sometimes, I think it is better to chase something you can never reach (becoming an outstanding mathematician), if in the process it forces you to evolve and learn at incredibly faster rate. 

**Important Note**: Despite it seeming like I have a ‘knack’ for math to others, they really just don't see all the effort behind the results. Honestly, I think that I am naturally less mathy than many of my friends.
