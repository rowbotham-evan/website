This was an independent study conducted under [Farez Siddiqui](https://www.math.fsu.edu/People/grads.php?id=1956), through the Math Department's [Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://fsumathdrp.wixsite.com/fsumathdrp). 

* Researched reinforment learning with an emphasis on applications in finance. My primary research text was Barto and Sutton's [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf).
* Designed an RL model using monte carlo simulations to find the optimal policy for playing blackjack. You can find it on my github, [here](https://github.com/rowbotham-evan/DRP_Blackjack).
